The project consists of two sections, public and src

Public contains the model assets (texture, gltf file etc) and index.html.
These don't need editing.

src contains all the coding files, which can be edited.
GLTFJSX is run inside the public folder for each model, with the output being transferred to the src folder for actual use.
All artefacts and their adjacent assets are held inside the "space_exhibition_assets" folder

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This installs all the project's dependencies and allows for the remaining scripts to be properly run.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
